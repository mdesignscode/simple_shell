**A Simple Shell**
__Author: Marlon Baatjes__

What is a shell?
"A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts."

My **Simple Shell** has the following implementations:

__exit__ - to exit the shell
__env__ - print the current environment
handles the PATH environment vatiable for searching for an executable
executes command lines with arguments

Usage: ./hsh
